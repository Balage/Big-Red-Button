# Big Red Buttonâ„¢

A big red button with an Arduino Leonardo (MEGA32U4) acting as a keyboard.

This code is an extended version of the Keyboard library already present in the Arduino IDE. What the official version lacks is the support for Page 0x01 keys (like Volume Up/Down, Mute, Sleep, Power Off), and the support for reading LED status.

The intention with this library was to build a big red button that acts like a keyboard, allowing a software in the background to listen on the pressed keys and do things when that happen. I mainly use it as a party tool to make sound effects, like for a gaming event. I wrote an app for this specific purpose, and it's also publicly available: [https://vbstudio.hu/apps/vasparittya](https://vbstudio.hu/apps/vasparittya).

You can also use it to...
- Trigger stuff that otherwise require multiple keys pressed simultaneously, like taking screenshots and recording video with *Xbox Game Bar* or *GeForce Experience* (see "[More use-case examples](#more-use-case-examples)" below).
- Host quiz shows, given you have more than one button. This would require a listener app that can tell who pressed their button first.
- Program macros.

## How to install code
- Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- The Arduino IDE by default stores all Sketches in a folder named "Arduino" in your Documents folder.
- Download the repository and copy everything from the "Source Code" folder to there.
	- It might ask whether you want to merge the "libraries" folder with the new one, choose yes.
- Start the Arduino IDE and select "File", "Sketches", and then choose "BigRedButton" from the list.

This sketch file contains all the relevant part to change and tweak behavior or switch I/O pins. The "under the hood" parts are located in the C++ classes under the "libraries" folder.

## Build and upload sketch
- After the Leonardo board is plugged in, go to "Tools", "Board", then select "Arduino Leonardo".
- Go to "Tools", "Port", and select the port that looks like "COM# (Arduino Leonardo)".
- Press and hold the reset button on the Leonardo board. (Add one if it does not have it)
- Start Upload.
- As soon as the console at the bottom says "Uploading...", release the reset button.
- It should finish in a few seconds, and then done.

## Changing keys
The `Keyboard` class specifies separate function calls for **page 0x01** and **page 0x07** keys.
Constants for the most common key codes and modifier keys are defined in `VbsKeyboard.h`.

### Page 0x07 key calls (regular keys)
``` c++
Keyboard.PressKey(uint8_t key, uint8_t modifier = MOD_NONE)
```
Issues a key press and then immediately a release for the specified `key`. One or multiple `modifier`-s can be specified to be pressed along with the key, like Ctrl, Alt, Shift or GUI (Window key). See `VbsKeyboard.h` for the available constants.

``` c++
Keyboard.HoldKey(uint8_t key, uint8_t modifier = MOD_NONE)
```
Same as `PressKey()`, except the key and modifiers remains pressed until `ReleaseKey()` is called.

``` c++
Keyboard.ReleaseKey()
```
Releases all currently pressed (page 0x07) keys.

### Page 0x01 key calls (system and media keys)
``` c++
Keyboard.PressKeyPage1(uint16_t key)
```
Issues a key press and then immediately a release for the specified page 0x01 `key`. No holding, or modifiers for this one.

## More use-case examples
Overwrite any of the preset programs with these.

### GeForce Experience screenshot/recording
Short press to take screenshot, long press to start/stop video recording.
``` c++
auto event = BigRedButton.PollDualButtonEvent();
if (event.Click) Keyboard.PressKey(KEY_F1, MOD_LEFT_ALT);
if (event.LongPress) Keyboard.PressKey(KEY_F9, MOD_LEFT_ALT);
```

### Xbox Game Bar screenshot/recording
Short press to take screenshot, long press to start/stop video recording.
``` c++
auto event = BigRedButton.PollDualButtonEvent();
if (event.Click) Keyboard.PressKey(KEY_PRINT_SCREEN, MOD_LEFT_GUI | MOD_LEFT_ALT);
if (event.LongPress) Keyboard.PressKey(KEY_R, MOD_LEFT_GUI | MOD_LEFT_ALT);
```
